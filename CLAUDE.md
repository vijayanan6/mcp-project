```

Cross-module imports inside `src/backend/` stay flat (e.g. `from database import ...` in `api.py`) rather
than becoming a real installable package — `uvicorn`/scripts add `src/backend/` to `sys.path` via
`--app-dir` or an explicit `sys.path.insert` instead. See the "Commands" run lines below for the exact
invocations this requires.

## Commands

```powershell
# Install all dependencies
pip install anthropic[mcp] mcp pymupdf pytesseract pypdf fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" chromadb sentence-transformers python-dotenv httpx

# Run the web app (primary entry point) — from the project root
python -m uvicorn api:app --reload --port 8000 --app-dir src/backend
# Open: http://localhost:8000

# Run the CLI agent (original learning version) — from the project root
python src/backend/agent.py

# Run eval pipeline (WARNING: consumes API credits — 1 Claude API call per test case)
# Start the app first, then in a second terminal:
python evals/run_evals.py

# Convert scanned PDFs in knowledge_base/ to .txt using Tesseract OCR
python scripts/convert_pdfs.py

# Inspect SQLite database contents
python scripts/inspect_db.py

# Tool Use Fundamentals demo (WARNING: consumes API credits — ~6 short Claude API calls)
python scripts/tool_use_demo.py
```

Tesseract must be installed at `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\` for `convert_pdfs.py` to work.

## Architecture

Three processes when the web app runs:

**`src/backend/api.py`** — FastAPI web server. Spawns `src/backend/mcp_server.py` on startup via lifespan, keeps it alive across all requests. Handles HTTP routes, SSE streaming, session management. Auto-indexes `knowledge_base/` into ChromaDB on startup. Stores sessions in SQLite. Also declares two non-MCP Anthropic tools directly in `app.state.tools` — see "Non-MCP Tools" below.

**`src/backend/mcp_server.py`** — MCP server exposing all three MCP primitives: 8 tools, 2 resource kinds (`knowledgebase://files`, `note://<title>`), and 1 prompt (`summarize_document`) — see "MCP Resources & Prompts" below. No knowledge of Claude or HTTP. Notes stored in SQLite via `database.py`. Document search via `rag.py` + ChromaDB.

**`src/backend/text_editor_tool.py`** — `ProjectNotesEditorTool`, a client-side Anthropic builtin tool (`BetaAsyncBuiltinFunctionTool`) executed in-process by `api.py`, not via MCP.

**`src/backend/agent.py`** — Original CLI version. Same MCP connection logic as `api.py` but uses `input()` instead of HTTP.

```

## Tools (10 total)

Three different execution models share one `tools` list passed to Claude — don't assume every tool is an MCP tool.

| Tool | Execution | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `get_current_datetime` | MCP | No params |
| `calculate` | MCP | `eval()` with restricted namespace — only math functions allowed |
| `get_weather` | MCP | Mock data dict — replace with real API for production |
| `manage_notes` | MCP | SQLite-backed — persists across restarts via `database.py` |
| `list_docs` | MCP | Reads `knowledge_base/` folder; supports `.txt .md .csv .json .py .html .xml .pdf` |
| `read_doc` | MCP | Path traversal blocked; 8000-char cap; PDF via `pypdf` or `pymupdf+Tesseract` |
| `index_docs` | MCP | Chunks all docs → embeds with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` → stores in ChromaDB |
| `search_docs` | MCP | Semantic search via ChromaDB; returns top N chunks with relevance scores |
| `web_search` | **Server-side** | Anthropic-hosted, no local code executes it. `max_uses: 3` caps searches/turn. `allowed_callers: ["direct"]` is required — the `web_search_20260209` default (`["code_execution_20260120"]`, for dynamic filtering) 400s on Haiku, which `_pick_model()` can route to and which doesn't support programmatic tool calling. |
| `str_replace_based_edit_tool` | **Client-side** | `ProjectNotesEditorTool` in `text_editor_tool.py`. Hardcoded to `knowledge_base/project_notes.md` only — every path Claude sends is resolved and compared against that exact file; anything else (other `knowledge_base/` files, `../` traversal, absolute paths) raises `ToolError` before touching disk. |

## Adding a New Tool

**MCP tool** (runs in `mcp_server.py`, needs local execution logic):
1. Add a `types.Tool(...)` entry in `list_tools()` in `mcp_server.py`
2. Add an `if name == "tool_name":` handler in `call_tool()` returning `list[types.TextContent]`
3. Restart `api.py` — tool discovery is automatic on each session start

**Anthropic server-side tool** (e.g. web_search, code_execution): declare it as a plain dict directly in `app.state.tools` in `api.py`'s lifespan (see `web_search_tool` there) — Anthropic executes it, no local handler needed. Check `allowed_callers` against every model your app routes to, per the `web_search` gotcha above.

**Anthropic client-side builtin tool** (e.g. text editor, bash): write a class implementing `anthropic.lib.tools.BetaAsyncBuiltinFunctionTool` (`to_dict()` returns the tool declaration, `call(input)` executes it) — see `text_editor_tool.py` — and instantiate it into `app.state.tools`. Client-side tools must NOT be declared as raw dicts in `tool_runner()`'s `tools` list — the runner only executes objects implementing this interface.

`server_tool_use` blocks (server-side tools) are a **different content-block type** than `tool_use` (client/MCP tools) in the response stream — code that only checks `block.type == "tool_use"` for logging/tracking (e.g. `tools_used.append(...)`) will silently miss every server-side tool call. Handle both types wherever tool calls are counted.

## MCP Resources & Prompts

`mcp_server.py` uses all three MCP primitives, not just tools:

- **Resources** (`@app.list_resources()` / `@app.read_resource()`) — read-only, URI-addressable data the client reads directly, without a function call. Two kinds, both dynamically enumerated on every `list_resources()` call so they reflect current state: `knowledgebase://files` (static — same listing `list_docs` returns, exposed as a resource instead of a tool call) and `note://<url-quoted-title>`, one per row in `note_list()`. Notes are keyed by `title` (TEXT PRIMARY KEY in `database.py`), not a numeric ID, so the URI encodes the title directly via `urllib.parse.quote`/`unquote` — verified this round-trips correctly for spaces, mixed case, and slashes via `pydantic.AnyUrl`.
- **Prompts** (`@app.list_prompts()` / `@app.get_prompt()`) — reusable request templates a client can invoke by name. `summarize_document` takes a `filename` argument and returns a pre-built message that drives the existing `read_doc`/`search_docs` tools, rather than introducing an unrelated example.

**Gotcha found via testing, not guessing:** a URI scheme cannot contain an underscore per RFC 3986 (`scheme = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." )`) — `AnyUrl("knowledge_base://files")` raises a `url_parsing` validation error; `AnyUrl("knowledgebase://files")` (no underscore) is required instead.

Tested via a direct `mcp.ClientSession` script (`list_resources`/`read_resource`/`list_prompts`/`get_prompt`) rather than only through MCP Inspector's UI — Inspector's browser-based proxy requires a session auth token printed to the launching terminal, which blocked automated verification; the direct client script exercises the identical protocol calls Inspector's UI makes.

**Reachable through the running app, not just standalone scripts/Inspector:** `api.py`'s `lifespan()` keeps the `mcp_session` on `app.state.mcp_session` (not just the tool wrappers), and four routes call it live — `GET /resources`, `GET /resources/content?uri=...`, `GET /prompts`, `POST /prompts/{name}`. This was a real gap found by `/code-review` (GitHub issue #4): the two primitives were fully implemented server-side but the client (`api.py`) never called `list_resources()`/`list_prompts()` at all, so the entire feature was dead code from the running app's perspective until fixed. `/resources`/`/prompts` are plain JSON routes, not additional entries in the `tools` list Claude sees — they're a separate access pattern (client reads a resource directly, or invokes a prompt template), not new Claude-facing tools.

## Image + PDF Attachments (Chat)

Not an MCP/server-side/client-side tool like the 10 above — this is a native Anthropic Messages API content-block feature (vision + document), wired directly into `/chat` and `/stream`. `ChatRequest.attachment` (`Attachment` model: `media_type`, `data` base64, optional `filename`) carries at most one image or PDF per turn.

**Ephemeral by design:** `history` (what `session_save()` persists to SQLite) only ever receives plain text from `_history_text_for()` — the message plus a `[User attached a file: name]` marker, never the base64 binary. The multimodal content block only exists in the locally-built `api_messages` list from `_build_api_messages()`, used for that one `tool_runner` call and discarded after. A later turn in the same session has no way to re-see the file unless it's re-attached — confirmed via SQLite inspection during testing (every persisted `content` field is a plain string). `attachment.filename` is documented as display-only and deliberately unvalidated by `_validate_attachment()`, but it still lands in that persisted marker and gets resent to Claude as ordinary text on later turns — `_history_text_for()` routes it through the same `_sanitize_input()` the message text already uses before embedding it (GitHub issue #2).

**Validation:** `_validate_attachment()` raises `HTTPException(400)` before any state changes for an unsupported `media_type` (allowlist: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`, `application/pdf`), invalid base64, or oversized payload (`_MAX_IMAGE_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` = 5MB, matching Anthropic's own image limit; `_MAX_PDF_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` = 10MB). In `/stream`, this validation runs in `stream_chat()`'s body *before* `StreamingResponse` is constructed, so a 400 comes back as a normal JSON error, not a broken SSE stream — the frontend's `send()` in `chat.html` checks `!res.ok` before parsing SSE for exactly this reason. Whitespace/newlines are stripped from the base64 payload before decoding (standard line-wrapped encoders like Python's `base64.encodebytes` or the Unix `base64` CLI insert a newline every 76 chars, which `validate=True` would otherwise reject — only the JS client's single-line `FileReader` output passed before this fix). The decoded size is also derived exactly from the encoded length *before* decoding, so an oversized payload is rejected without paying the cost of actually decoding it first (GitHub issues #6, #7).

**Attachment-aware model routing:** `_pick_model(message, has_attachment=...)` always routes to Sonnet when an attachment is present, regardless of the text message — `chat.html` allows sending an attachment with no typed text, and an empty message string has no signal about the attached document/image's actual complexity (GitHub issue #3; previously this case silently routed to Haiku).

**Limits served from the backend, not triplicated:** `GET /attachment-limits` returns the allowed MIME types and size caps as JSON; `chat.html` fetches it on load and updates its JS constants (`ATTACHMENT_ALLOWED_TYPES`, `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`, `MAX_PDF_BYTES`) and the file input's `accept` attribute from the response, instead of the type/cap values existing independently in three places (backend, JS constants, `accept` attribute) able to silently drift out of sync (GitHub issue #11). The JS constants keep their original hardcoded values as the pre-fetch default so the UI still works during the brief window before the fetch resolves.

**Citations (PDF only):** `_attachment_content_block()` adds `citations: {enabled: true}` to `document`-type blocks (not `image` blocks — citations don't apply to images). When Claude cites a specific page, both endpoints append an inline `(p.N)` marker to the response text via the shared `_text_with_citations(block)` helper, which reads `start_page_number` directly off each citation object — extracted into one function after `/chat` and `/stream` each had their own copy of the identical loop (GitHub issue #10). **Gotcha found during testing:** the citation object's location fields are flat with a `type: "page_location"` discriminator string — not nested under a `.page_location` sub-attribute the way the field name might suggest. Also: citations only work against a PDF with a real embedded text layer — a purely rasterized/image-based PDF (e.g. one built by saving images via Pillow) has nothing for Claude to cite against, which is correct behavior, not a bug.

**No new cost-tracking code needed** — image/PDF tokens bill as ordinary `input_tokens` in the API response, already captured by the existing `usage_log()` → `_estimate_cost()` pipeline. Confirmed during testing: a PDF-attached turn showed `2814 in` vs. `1002 in` for a plain-text follow-up in the same session, and the `/usage` totals picked up the difference automatically.

**Frontend (`chat.html`):** a 📎 button + hidden `<input type="file">` in the footer, client-side allowlist/size checks mirroring the backend exactly, and a filename chip with a remove (×) control. Drag-drop/paste and multiple attachments per turn are explicitly out of scope for now — file-picker, one file, is the only supported flow.

## Cost Dashboard & Credit Tracking

`GET  /usage`         — visual HTML dashboard (token usage, cost, daily chart, per-session table)
`GET  /usage/data`    — JSON: totals, by_model, by_day, by_session, by_tool, by_project, credit config
`GET  /usage/data?project=name` — same but filtered to one project
`POST /usage/credit`  — save starting balance and alert threshold `{ starting_balance: 5.00, alert_threshold: 1.00, reset: false }`

Features: credit balance tracker, burn rate ($/day), estimated runway (labeled "Est. Runway" — a burn-rate forecast, not an actual credit expiration; API credits don't expire on a day count), 30/60/90-day cost forecast, per-session cost table, cost by tool, cost by project, low-credit alert badge in chat header (pulses red when remaining < threshold).

**Pricing table maintenance:** `database.py`'s `_PRICING` dict is a manual snapshot — Anthropic's API has no endpoint that returns live pricing (the Models API returns capabilities/context window, not cost). Found stale on 2026-07-15: `claude-haiku-4-5` carried old Haiku-3.5-era rates ($0.0008/$0.004 per 1K instead of the correct $0.001/$0.005), undercounting every Haiku-routed request by ~20%, caught only by comparing the dashboard's "remaining" balance against the real console.anthropic.com figure — fixed, and all 44 affected historical rows in `usage_logs` were recomputed and backfilled (not just fixed going forward). Re-verify `_PRICING` by hand against console.anthropic.com/settings/billing (or the claude-api skill's Current Models table) whenever Anthropic changes pricing, or whenever `_pick_model()` starts routing to a model not yet in the dict. `_estimate_cost()`'s fallback for an unrecognized model now prints a console warning instead of silently inheriting Sonnet's rate — that silent fallback is exactly what let the Haiku drift go unnoticed.

**web_search cost tracking:** `web_search` is billed at $10 per 1,000 searches ($0.01/use) on top of normal token costs — a flat server-side fee, not derivable from token counts. `usage_logs.web_search_requests` (read from `usage.server_tool_use.web_search_requests` on each turn) stores the raw count; `_estimate_cost()` in `database.py` folds `web_search_requests × $0.01` into `estimated_cost_usd`, so it flows automatically into every existing aggregate (by_model, by_day, by_session, by_tool, by_project, credit/burn-rate math) with no separate dashboard wiring. The "Web Searches" stat card on `/usage` surfaces the raw count.

**Cost by Tool attribution — one turn's cost, once per distinct tool, not once per mention:** `usage_summary()`'s `by_tool` query explodes each row's `tools_used` JSON array via `json_each()`. `estimated_cost_usd` belongs to the *turn*, not to any individual tool call within it — a turn that calls the same tool more than once (e.g. `tools_used = ["code_execution", "web_search", "code_execution", "web_search", "code_execution"]`) would have that turn's cost summed once per repeated mention if grouped directly on the exploded rows, inflating `cost_usd`/`avg_cost_usd` by however many times a tool was called within one turn (found via a real example: 3 `code_execution` mentions in 1 turn reported as $0.1510, 3× the turn's real $0.0503 cost — the `calls` count next to it was correct, which is exactly what made the wrong number look trustworthy). Fixed by grouping to `(usage_logs.id, tool_name)` first — attributing a turn's cost once per distinct tool it used — before aggregating across turns. See Insight #37. **The same dedup fix also silently corrected `str_replace_based_edit_tool`'s cost** (also had within-turn repeats, also 3×-inflated) — confirming the fix was general, not narrowly patched to the one case that surfaced it.

**`code_execution` is relabeled to `web_search` in the `by_tool` display, deliberately:** `code_execution` has no pricing model of its own in `_estimate_cost()` (unlike `web_search`'s flat $0.01/use fee) — its one historical appearance (2026-07-08, before `allowed_callers: ["direct"]` was committed) was Anthropic's sandbox wrapping a `web_search` call, not independent work. The `CASE WHEN json_each.value = 'code_execution' THEN 'web_search'` mapping lives only in the `by_tool` aggregation query — the raw `tools_used` JSON in `usage_logs` is never rewritten, so the actual historical record (what the API really reported) stays intact if it's ever worth auditing again. This is a presentation decision, not a data correction — worth distinguishing from the dedup fix above, which corrected genuinely wrong math.

### Discord Mobile Alerts

The in-dashboard badge only helps if the browser tab is open. `_run_alert_checks()` in `api.py` runs after every logged request (`/chat` and `/stream`) and pushes real-time alerts to a Discord webhook — Discord's mobile app turns these into phone push notifications, so alerts reach you without the dashboard open.

**Config:** `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` in `.env` (optional — every check silently no-ops if unset). No other secret involved; email was deliberately skipped as a channel — it needs a heavier credential (SMTP/app password) for a channel that isn't checked. The URL lives only in `.env` (gitignored), read via `os.environ`, never stored in SQLite or returned by any API endpoint.

**Six alert types, each independently cooldown-gated so none of them can spam Discord:**

| Alert | Trigger | Cooldown | Config |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟡 Warning (low balance) | `remaining ≤ warning_threshold` (and above critical) | 24h, clears on recovery above `warning_threshold` | `credit_config.warning_threshold`, default $5 |
| 🔴 Critical (low balance) | `remaining ≤ alert_threshold` | 24h, clears on recovery above `alert_threshold`; also clears a stale warning cooldown (critical supersedes warning) | `credit_config.alert_threshold`, default $1 — same field the dashboard badge already uses |
| 📈 Spend spike | Today's spend ≥ `SPIKE_MIN_ABSOLUTE` ($1) **and** ≥ `SPIKE_MULTIPLIER` (3×) the trailing 7-day daily average | Once per calendar day | Constants in `api.py` — catches a runaway loop or bug *causing* spend, not just the low balance that results from it |
| 🔎 web_search budget | `web_search`'s cost alone (exact, via `web_search_requests × $0.01`) exceeds `WEB_SEARCH_DAILY_BUDGET` ($1) for the day | Once per calendar day | Constant in `api.py` |
| 📋 Daily digest | First request of a new calendar day | Once per calendar day | N/A — fires with yesterday's spend/tokens/top-tools recap, plus an "Available credit" line (same `remaining` formula as the dashboard banner) when credit tracking is configured (`starting_balance > 0`) |
| ⚠️ Missing pricing data | `_pick_model()` routes to a model with no `_PRICING` entry (`_estimate_cost()`'s fallback fires) | **One-time per model**, not a daily cooldown — a config gap, not a spend threshold; stops recurring once a real `_PRICING` entry is added | `pricing_warnings` SQLite table (`model`, `first_seen_at`, `alert_sent_at`) — GitHub issue #5. Previously this only printed to stdout, which is exactly the "silent until someone happens to notice" failure mode that let the Haiku pricing drift above go unnoticed in the first place. |

**Why the digest fires on first-request-of-the-day, not a fixed time:** this app only runs when `uvicorn` is started — there's no guarantee it's running at any fixed wall-clock time, so a background scheduler (e.g. APScheduler firing at 8am) could silently miss days entirely. Piggybacking on real traffic means the digest always eventually fires, just possibly later than a fixed hour on light-usage days.

**`warning_threshold` is stored but not yet in the dashboard UI** — change it via `POST /usage/credit` with `{"warning_threshold": N}` (omit the field entirely to leave it unchanged; the existing dashboard form doesn't send it, so it can't accidentally reset it).

**Two-tier low-balance logic (`_maybe_send_low_credit_alert`) mirrors the exact "remaining" formula the dashboard banner uses** (`usage.html`): `remaining = max(starting_balance - period_cost_usd, 0)`. Critical is checked first — being in the critical zone skips the warning tier entirely (it would be a redundant, less-urgent duplicate).

### Resetting Spend Tracking (Balance Top-Ups)

A real Anthropic account top-up doesn't mean past spend should keep counting against the new balance. The "Reset spend tracking" checkbox in the credit banner (with a confirm prompt, since it overwrites the single archived snapshot below) sets `reset: true` on `POST /usage/credit`, which:

- Starts a new tracking period from now (`credit_config.period_start`) — remaining balance, burn rate, and forecasts recalculate from that point forward.
- Archives the outgoing period's totals into `prev_period_cost_usd` / `prev_period_days` / `prev_period_end` — a **single slot**, overwritten on every reset. There's a confirm dialog specifically because this data isn't recoverable if you reset twice in a row.
- **Never touches `usage_logs`.** All historical charts (daily chart, per-model, per-session, per-project tables) always show full lifetime data regardless of resets — only the credit banner's live remaining/burn-rate math is period-scoped.

`database.py`'s `credit_status(project=None)` computes the live period's spend/active-days (falling back to all-time totals if never reset, so existing installs behave unchanged). The dashboard JS falls back to the *previous* period's burn rate — marked `(est.)` with a tooltip — for forecasting in the gap right after a reset, before any usage has landed in the new period; it switches to real numbers once a request is logged.

## Multi-Project Support — How to Wire Up a New Project

This dashboard supports multiple projects reporting to a single SQLite database. All data is tagged by `project` column in `usage_logs`.

**To add a second project:**

1. Copy `src/backend/database.py` into the new project (or import it as a shared module)
2. Point `DB_PATH` to the same `data.db` file used by this project:
   ```python
   DB_PATH = Path("c:/Users/vijay/OneDrive/Desktop/Claude Workspace/MCP Project/data/data.db")
   ```
3. In the new project's streaming endpoint, pass the project name to `usage_log()`:
   ```python
   usage_log(session_id, model, input, cache_write, cache_read, output,
             tools=tools_called, project="my-new-project")
   ```
4. That's it — the new project appears in the dashboard dropdown automatically.

**Filter in dashboard:** Use the Project dropdown in the header to view one project at a time. All cards, charts, and tables filter to the selected project.

**Future upgrade path:** When deployed to GCP, replace the shared file path with a `POST /usage/log` endpoint so any project anywhere can report usage over HTTP — this is Option A (centralised dashboard). Option C (shared file) works locally; Option A works in production.

## Persistence

- **SQLite** (`data/data.db`) — notes, sessions, usage_logs, credit_config tables. Managed by `database.py`. Auto-created on startup.
- **ChromaDB** (`data/chroma_db/`) — vector embeddings for semantic doc search. Managed by `rag.py`. Auto-indexed on `api.py` startup.
- Both `data/data.db` and `data/chroma_db/` are in `.gitignore` — local only.

## knowledge_base/ Folder

Place `.txt`, `.md`, or `.pdf` files here (renamed from `docs/` in the Phase 22 reorg — `docs/` is now project markdown documentation instead). Scanned PDFs must be pre-converted via `scripts/convert_pdfs.py` (Tesseract OCR). Text-based PDFs are read directly via `pypdf`. All files here are auto-indexed into ChromaDB on `api.py` startup. Re-index after adding new files by saying "Re-index my documents" in chat or restarting the server.

## System Prompt Behaviour

`api.py` uses a smart system prompt that tells Claude to call `search_docs` first for topic-specific questions (people, projects, subjects) but skip it for clearly general questions (math, weather, time). This avoids unnecessary tool calls while still prioritising document content.

The prompt is defined as `SYSTEM_PROMPT` with `cache_control: ephemeral` so Anthropic caches it across turns — saving ~90% of those input tokens after the first call.

Conversation history is capped at the last **10 messages** (`HISTORY_LIMIT`) to keep context size bounded. Full history is still persisted to SQLite; only the window sent to Claude is trimmed.

Both `/chat` and `/stream` slice their history window through the same module-level `_safe_window()` (never split a `tool_use`/`tool_result` pair — drops a leading orphaned `tool_result` if the window boundary lands mid-pair). `_safe_window()` used to be a closure local to `stream_chat()`, so `/chat` had no equivalent guard and could send Anthropic a malformed window in a long tool-heavy session (a real gap, GitHub issue #9) — hoisted to module scope so both routes share one implementation instead of `/chat` getting a duplicated copy.

## API Error Handling

`AsyncAnthropic`'s default `max_retries=2` already retries 429/5xx/timeout/connection errors internally with exponential backoff + jitter (honoring a `Retry-After` header when present) before raising — confirmed by reading `anthropic/_base_client.py`'s `_should_retry`/`_calculate_retry_timeout`, not assumed. Don't hand-roll a second retry loop around `tool_runner()`; it would just duplicate what the SDK already does.

What *was* missing: a clean failure path once those built-in retries are exhausted. `/chat`'s `tool_runner` loop previously had no error handling at all — any Anthropic API error propagated as a raw 500 with a full traceback. Both `/chat` and `/stream` now catch `anthropic.APIError` (the common base class for `RateLimitError`/`APITimeoutError`/`APIConnectionError`/`APIStatusError`) specifically: `/chat` raises a clean `HTTPException(503, ...)`, `/stream` yields a clean `{"type": "error", ...}` SSE event instead of leaking the raw exception string. A broader `except Exception` still exists in `/stream` as a fallback for genuinely unexpected (non-Anthropic) errors.

## SSL Note (Windows)

Two SSL patches are applied on Windows machines with corporate certificate chains or network monitoring drivers:

1. **`rag.py`** — patches `httpx.Client.__init__` and `httpx.AsyncClient.__init__` to default `verify=False` before the HuggingFace model download. The model (~80MB) is cached after first download.
2. **`api.py` lifespan** — clears the `SSLKEYLOGFILE` environment variable (set by monitoring drivers like `nllMonFltProxy`) and passes `httpx.AsyncClient(verify=False)` explicitly to `AsyncAnthropic()` to prevent SSL context creation failures.

## .env Encoding Note (Windows)

`.env` must be saved as plain **UTF-8 (no BOM)**. Windows tools (Notepad, some PowerShell
`Set-Content`/`Out-File` defaults) commonly save "UTF-8 with BOM" instead. The BOM character
silently merges with the first line, turning `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` into an unrecognized variable
name — `python-dotenv` never loads it, and the SDK fails with a generic
`"Could not resolve authentication method"` error even though the key itself is correct.

Verify without exposing the key: `grep -c "^ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=" .env` should return `1`. If it
returns `0`, strip the BOM:
```powershell
$content = Get-Content -Raw -Path .env
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText(".env", $content, (New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding $false))
```
Note `uvicorn --reload` does not watch `.env` for changes — a full process restart is required
after fixing it.

## Playwright MCP (UI Testing)

A Playwright MCP server is configured at project scope in `.mcp.json` (Microsoft's official
`@playwright/mcp` package, no secrets in config, safe to share). It lets Claude Code drive
`chat.html` and `usage.html` in a real browser — navigate, click, type, screenshot — to verify
UI changes actually work, per the testing standard in this file, instead of only reading source.

Screenshots and page snapshots land in `.playwright-mcp/` — gitignored, since they can contain
session IDs and cost data from local testing.

## Security Standard — After Every Change

After any file edit, new dependency, new MCP server, or config change: check `git status` for
new untracked files, confirm nothing secret is in what's about to be committed, and confirm
`.gitignore` covers any new artifact-producing tool (test output, logs, generated screenshots).
Never print a secret value to diagnose it — use structural checks (`grep -c`, redacted `sed`)
instead. This applies to every change in this repo, not just app code.

## Secret Scanning & Commit Signing

A `gitleaks` pre-commit hook lives at `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (local only — not tracked or
shared via clone, like all git hooks). It runs `gitleaks protect --staged --redact --verbose`
on every `git commit`, scanning only what's staged, and blocks the commit (non-zero exit) if a
likely secret is found. `--redact` means it reports *where* a secret was found, never the value
itself. If it ever blocks a false positive, add an allowlist rule to a `.gitleaks.toml` file
(not currently present — only needed if a false positive occurs).

All commits are also SSH-signed (`git config --global commit.gpgsign true`, `gpg.format ssh`,
signing key at `~/.ssh/git_signing_key`) — this is a **global** git config, not scoped to this
repo, so it applies to every repo on this machine. Signed commits show a green "Verified" badge
on GitHub. Verify signing status with `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/<sha> --jq
'.commit.verification'` rather than `git log --show-signature`, which reports `No signature`
locally unless `gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile` is separately configured — that's a local display
limitation, not a sign the commit is actually unsigned.

Run `pip-audit` periodically to check installed dependencies for known CVEs. On this machine,
`pip-audit`'s PyPI lookups fail with `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` due to corporate SSL
interception (same root cause as the SSL Note above, but a different fix — `pip` itself isn't
affected, only `requests`/`urllib3`-based tools are). Fixed once via `pip install
pip_system_certs`, which makes Python defer to the Windows certificate store instead of
`certifi`'s bundled CA list. When a scan flags a CVE, check whether this project's code actually
exercises the vulnerable code path before treating it as actionable — e.g. a ChromaDB RCE
advisory affecting its standalone HTTP server API doesn't apply here, since `rag.py` only uses
`chromadb.PersistentClient` (embedded, no network listener).

## Git Workflow

See `GIT_COMMANDS.md` for the full reference. Standard workflow:

```powershell
git checkout -b feature/name     # new feature branch
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description"
git checkout main
git merge feature/name
git push origin main
```

Commit prefix conventions: `feat:` new feature — `docs:` documentation — `fix:` bug fix

## Eval Pipeline

`evals/dataset.json` — 12 test cases covering tool selection and model routing
`evals/run_evals.py` — runner that calls `/chat`, scores results, exits 1 on failure

Currently passing: **12/12 (100%)**

Run after every system prompt change or model routing change to catch regressions.
